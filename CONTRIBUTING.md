# Contributing to Product OS Framework

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This project follows a lightweight process so we can merge changes without friction while keeping quality high.

## How to contribute

- **Bug reports and feature ideas:** Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/nimidev/product-OS-framework/issues). For features, describe the problem and expected behavior so maintainers can triage and optionally turn it into a story.
- **Code and docs:** Open a Pull Request against `main`. Keep PRs focused (one concern per PR when possible).

## Pull request process

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes. Run tests: `npm test`.
3. Push your branch and open a PR. Describe what changed and why.
4. A maintainer will review and may request changes. Once approved, we’ll merge.

## Scope

- **In scope:** CLI (`bin/`, `lib/`), templates (`templates/`), docs (README, CURSOR_SLASH_COMMANDS, PROCESS), and tests.
- **Out of scope for this repo:** Product-docs and story backlogs (e.g. `product-docs/`) are maintainer-local and not part of the open source repo. Use `prd init` in your own workspace to create your backlogs.

## Questions

Open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/nimidev/product-OS-framework/discussions) or an Issue and we’ll respond when we can.
