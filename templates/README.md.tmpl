# {{workspaceName}}

Product documentation workspace powered by [Product OS Framework](https://github.com/nimidev/product-OS-framework).

## Projects

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [{{projectName}}](./{{projectName}}/) | {{projectDescription}} |

## Story ID Registry

**Next Available ID: {{nextId}}**

When creating a new story, use the next available ID. The `/create` command in Cursor handles this automatically.

## Quick Start

### For Product Managers

1. Open the workspace file in Cursor (`.code-workspace`)
2. Create a story: `/create "feature description" @{{projectName}}/backlog.md`
3. Refine requirements through conversation with the AI agent
4. Approve the PRD when ready

### For Developers

1. Open the workspace file in Cursor (`.code-workspace`)
2. Start development: `/dev US-{ID}`
3. The agent reads RULES.md and follows project standards
4. Ship it: `/release US-{ID}`

### Dashboard

View all stories from any terminal:

```bash
prd              # Full dashboard
prd list         # Compact view
prd stats        # Quick numbers
```

## Process

See [PROCESS.md](./PROCESS.md) for the complete product development workflow.

## Story File Format

Stories use YAML frontmatter for metadata:

```yaml
---
id: US-001
project: {{projectName}}
status: create
phase: planning
progress: 0
priority: P1
---

# Story Title

## Goal
What problem does this solve?

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ...
```

## Adding a New Project

```bash
prd add-project
```

This creates the project folder, backlog, RULES.md, and updates the workspace.
