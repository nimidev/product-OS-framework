# {{workspaceName}}

Product documentation workspace powered by [Product OS Framework](https://github.com/nimidev/product-OS-framework).

## Projects

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [{{projectName}}](./{{projectName}}/) | {{projectDescription}} |

## Story ID Registry

**Next Available ID: {{nextId}}**

When creating a new story, use the next available ID. The `/create` command in Cursor handles this automatically.

## Quick Start

### Phase 1 – Create & Verify (PRD)

1. Open the workspace file in Cursor (`.code-workspace`)
2. Create a story: `/create "feature description" @{{projectName}}/backlog.md`
3. Refine requirements through conversation with the AI agent
4. Let the agent verify the PRD and address any gaps
5. Approve the PRD when it is clear and ready for development

### Phase 2 – Dev (Implementation)

1. With the same workspace open, start development: `/dev US-{ID}`
2. The agent reads the PRD and `RULES.md`, proposes a plan, and implements tasks iteratively
3. Continue until all tasks are complete, tests pass, and ACs are covered

### Phase 3 – Release (Ship & Document)

1. When development is complete, run: `/release US-{ID}`
2. The agent helps review, merge, deploy, and update documentation
3. The story is marked as **done** in both product docs and code

### Dashboard

View all stories from any terminal:

```bash
prd              # Full dashboard
prd list         # Compact view
prd stats        # Quick numbers
```

## Process

See [PROCESS.md](./PROCESS.md) for the complete product development workflow.

## Story File Format

Stories use YAML frontmatter for metadata:

```yaml
---
id: US-001
project: {{projectName}}
status: create
phase: planning
progress: 0
priority: P1
---

# Story Title

## Goal
What problem does this solve?

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ...
```

## Adding a New Project

```bash
prd add-project
```

This creates the project folder, backlog, RULES.md, and updates the workspace.
